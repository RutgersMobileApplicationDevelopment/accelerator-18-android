# RUMAD Accelerator Android Track, Fall 2018

## Material for the Week

This week we learned about the following:

* Fragments
* RecyclerView
* Options Menu

## Relevant Links
* [Fragment](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments)
* [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview)
* [Menu](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/menus)

## Homework

Something we didn't cover is how a fragment's behavior is monitored by its hosting activity. In this assignment, we would like you to simply display the item index that is clicked in the WeatherListFragment's recyclerview in the activity's top toolbar. Here is the corresponding resource for this task: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/communicating. 

I have included a static array of names that you'll use to bind to your recyclerview items.​ Each one of these names can be displayed in the top toolbar.

You can also customize the look of your recyclerview items as well as swap different layout managers to view how they get arranged differently.

## What we did
We learned (at a basic level) how the internet works and how to interact with APIs over the internet with Java. We made an Android app that displays the bio of a GitHub user when you give it a GitHub username. The completed source code for the project is in the `/GitHubApp` folder.

## What we covered
* What a web API request is
* The differences between GET and POST
* Some vocabulary terms:
    - Base url
    - Endpoint
    - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    - POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
    - Data class (AKA Javabean)
    - Serialization (converting to JSON)
    - Deserialization (converting from JSON)
* Using Retrofit with Gson to make network requests
* What "asychronous" means

## Homework
Make an app that uses an API like the app we made together. Here are some ideas that you can choose from:
* Add functionality to the GitHub app we made together. Maybe make it so that you can get information about a repository a user owns or something like that
* Make an app that tells you something about the weather. It can be as simple as telling you the current degrees outside. Here are some available APIs (they require you to sign up to get an API key, let me know if you need help with this)
    - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
    - [Yahoo Weather](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)
* Make an app that [translates English into Minion](https://rapidapi.com/orthosie/api/Minion%20Translator) (this also requires you to make an account and only allows 15 requests per day)
* Check out some other free and fun APIs [this API marketplace](https://rapidapi.com/) or any other marketplace you can find!

## Material for Others
